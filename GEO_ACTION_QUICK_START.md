---

## Quick Start: 3 Steps

### Step 1: Generate Content (5 minutes)

1. Go to: **https://geoaction.tocanan.ai**
2. Fill in:
   - **Client Name:** "Ocean Park Hong Kong"
   - **Target Question:** "What are the main attractions at Ocean Park Hong Kong?"
   - **Reference URLs:** 3-5 quality sources (official sites, gov, academic)
3. Click **"Generate Content"**
4. Wait 60-90 seconds

---

### Step 2: Optimize Your Output (1-2 hours)

**You'll receive 5 insight cards. Focus on these 2:**

#### Card 1: Implementation Checklist ⭐ MOST IMPORTANT
- **What it shows:** Prioritized actions (High/Medium/Low)
- **What to do:**
  - ✅ **Implement ALL High Priority items before publishing**
  - Examples:
    - "Add 4 citations" → Research and add authoritative sources
    - "Add 3 statistics" → Find recent data with attribution
    - "Enhance E-E-A-T signals" → Add expert quotes or examples
- **Time:** 30-60 minutes
- **Impact:** +40-60% visibility potential

#### Card 2: Benchmark Comparison
- **What it shows:** How you compare vs top competitors (0-100%)
- **What to do:**
  - If <70%: Close your largest gap (e.g., add missing citations)
  - If 70-84%: Close top 2 gaps to reach 85%+
  - If 85%+: You're competitive, publish with confidence
- **Time:** 15-30 minutes
- **Impact:** +10-15% per gap closed

**Quick Rule:** Always aim for 85%+ competitiveness before publishing.

---

### Step 3: Publish with Schema (15 minutes)

1. **Copy your optimized content** (HTML/Markdown export)
2. **Copy JSON-LD schema markup**
3. **Paste schema into your webpage's `<head>` section:**

```html
<head>
  <script type="application/ld+json">
  { /* paste schema here */ }
  </script>
</head>
```

4. **Paste content into your CMS** (WordPress, Medium, etc.)
5. **Publish**

## Interpreting Your Results (The 3 Most Important Things)

### 1. Evaluation Score (0-100)

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **85-100** | ✅ Publish as-is, excellent quality |
| **70-84** | ⚠️ Implement High Priority checklist items first |
| **<70** | ❌ Re-generate with better reference URLs |

---

### 2. Implementation Checklist Priorities

| Priority | Impact | When to Do |
|----------|--------|------------|
| 🔴 **High** | +15-20% each | **Before publishing** (non-negotiable) |
| 🟡 **Medium** | +10-15% each | Within 24 hours |
| 🟢 **Low** | +5-10% each | Optional (if time permits) |

**Example High Priority Item:**
```
🔴 HIGH PRIORITY - Citations
Current Gap: 0 citations found
Action: Add authoritative source links
Impact: +15-20% E-E-A-T Trust score
```

**What you do:**
1. Find 4-6 credible sources (government, academic, major news)
2. Add inline references: "According to [Source], [claim]"
3. Include hyperlinks if publishing online
4. ✅ Done - +15-20% visibility boost achieved

---

### 3. Competitiveness Score (%)

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **85-100%** | Market Leader | Maintain strengths, minor refinements |
| **70-84%** | Competitive | Close 1-2 key gaps to reach 85%+ |
| **<70%** | Below Average | Prioritize largest gaps, add missing elements |

**Example:**
```
Competitiveness: 72%
Gap: -4 citations (you have 2, target is 6)
```

**What you do:**
1. Add 4 more authoritative sources
2. Re-check: Likely now 85-90% competitive
3. ✅ Publish with confidence

---

## 5 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ 1. Publishing Without Implementing High Priority Items
- **Why it's bad:** Leaving 40-60% visibility potential unrealized
- **Fix:** Always complete High Priority items before publishing (30-60 min)

### ❌ 2. Ignoring Schema Markup
- **Why it's bad:** Missing 15-25% boost from structured data
- **Fix:** Copy JSON-LD and paste into `<head>` section (2 min)

### ❌ 3. Using Low-Quality Reference URLs
- **Why it's bad:** Poor input = poor output (low scores, missing data)
- **Fix:** Use government, academic, or industry research sources

### ❌ 4. Target Questions Too Broad
- **Why it's bad:** Can't optimize for vague questions
- **Fix:** Be specific (e.g., "What are eligibility requirements for Hong Kong Talent Scheme?" not "Tell me about Hong Kong")

### ❌ 5. Not Verifying Facts
- **Why it's bad:** AI can occasionally hallucinate statistics or quotes
- **Fix:** Spend 10 min checking all numbers and claims

---

## Content Verification System (NEW)

GEO Action now includes a **bullet-proof content validation system** to prevent fabricated statistics and quotes:

### How It Works

```
Reference URLs/Documents → Tavily Search (raw content extraction)
                                    ↓
                         Research Agent Parsing (extract stats/quotes)
                                    ↓
                         Perplexity AI Verification ← Grounded search with citations
                                    ↓
                         ✓ VERIFIED ONLY → Writer Agents
                                    ↓
                         If insufficient verified content → AUTO-RETRY (up to 2x)
```

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Verified-Only Filtering** | Only Perplexity-verified statistics and quotes reach the writer agents |
| **Automatic Retry** | If < 2 verified stats or < 1 verified quote, system automatically retries with alternative search terms |
| **Source URLs** | All verified content includes source URLs for transparency |
| **No Fabrication** | Unverified content is discarded; writers cannot cite unverified claims |

### What This Means for You

1. **All statistics are grounded** - Every number comes with a verified source URL
2. **All quotes are authentic** - Expert quotations are validated through Perplexity AI's grounded search
3. **No invented sources** - Writers only receive verified content; empty sections trigger "do not fabricate" instructions
4. **Automatic quality assurance** - The system retries searches if verification results are insufficient

### Verification Status in Output

When you receive generated content:

- Statistics and quotes have been **verified** through authoritative sources
- Source URLs are available in the API response (`source_url` field)
- `verified: true` and `verification_source: "perplexity"` flags confirm validation

## Measuring Success (7-14 Days After Publishing)

### Test 1: Direct AI Testing (5 minutes)
1. Ask your exact target question in ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity
2. Check if your content/website is cited
3. **Expected:** 30-60% citation rate

### Test 2: AI-Referral Traffic (Weekly check)
1. Check Google Analytics → Acquisition → Referrals
2. Look for: chatgpt.com, perplexity.ai, or "direct" traffic spikes
3. **Expected:** +20-40% growth in 2-4 weeks

---

## Troubleshooting: Top 3 Issues

### Issue 1: Low Evaluation Score (<60)

**Cause:** Insufficient or low-quality reference URLs

**Fix:**
1. Add 2-3 government or academic sources
2. Include industry research reports
3. Re-generate with better inputs

---

### Issue 2: Low Competitiveness (<70%)

**Cause:** Competitors have more citations/statistics

**Fix:**
1. Focus on closing citation gap first (highest impact)
2. Add 4-6 authoritative sources
3. Add 2-3 more statistics with attribution
4. Target: Reach 85%+ before publishing

---

### Issue 3: Not Seeing AI Citations After 14 Days

**Cause:** Content not competitive enough or schema not working

**Fix:**
1. Re-check competitiveness (was it <85%?)
2. Verify schema markup with Google Rich Results Test
3. Test with broader/more common variations of your question
4. Implement more Medium Priority checklist items

---
